#📌 Overview
This project implements a 4-bit Full Adder using Verilog HDL.
It demonstrates:
Dataflow modeling for a 1-bit full adder
Structural (gate-level) modeling by cascading four 1-bit full adders
A testbench to verify the functionality using different input combinations
🧩 Modules Description
## fulladd – 1-bit Full Adder (Dataflow Modeling)
This module performs single-bit addition with carry-in.

Inputs:
a – First input bit
b – Second input bit
cin – Carry input
Outputs:
sum – Sum output
carry – Carry output

Logic Used:
sum   = a ^ b ^ cin
carry = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin)

full_add4 – 4-bit Full Adder (Structural Modeling)
This top module connects four 1-bit full adders in cascade to perform 4-bit addition.
Inputs:
a[3:0] – 4-bit input A
b[3:0] – 4-bit input B
c_in – Carry input
Outputs:
sum[3:0] – 4-bit sum
c_out – Final carry output
Design Approach:
Carry from each stage is connected to the next stage
Ripple Carry Adder architecture is used

🧪 Testbench (tb_full_add4)
The testbench verifies the functionality of the 4-bit full adder by applying multiple test cases.
Features:
Uses $display and $monitor for real-time output
Applies different combinations of inputs
Simulation time scale: 1ns / 1ps

Sample Test Cases:
A	B	Cin	Expected Result
0000	0000	0	Sum = 0000
0011	0101	0	Sum = 1000
0111	0001	0	Sum = 1000
1111	0001	0	Sum = 0000, Cout = 1
1010	0101	1	Sum = 0000, Cout = 1
